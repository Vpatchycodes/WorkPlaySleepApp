# Work, Play, Sleep App
Wellness & Productivity App consisting of an all-in-one calendar to handle event scheduling, task creation, and wellness tracking integrations -- enhancing students' ability to be both productive and stay well. 

## PennWellApp Zip File
Main repo for PennWellApp. Contains the web app, as well as the wiki.

## Other Zip Files
Backend can be found at **project-naurrrwhals-backend.zip**

Mobile app can be found at **project-naurrrwhals-mobile.zip**

Our deployed app (no longer live) can be found at https://naurrrwhals.herokuapp.com/.

## To Run
Run with `npm start` from the `naur_app` directory in PennWellApp repo

The backend must also be running on the same machine. (It is probably more convenient to just run the backend on its own, which will automatically serve the frontend at the root.)
